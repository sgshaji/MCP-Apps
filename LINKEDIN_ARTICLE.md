I spent a weekend building a flight tracker that renders an interactive HTML widget inside Microsoft 365 Copilot.

✅ The tool works. The widget renders. You can click a flight row and see live aircraft altitude, speed, and heading — without leaving the chat window.

Here is what I built, how MCP Apps works, how it compares to Adaptive Cards, and what it can unlock in production.

## ✈️ Flight Tracker

The **Flight Tracker** is an MCP server that connects to M365 Copilot as a Declarative Agent. Give it any aircraft's ICAO24 transponder code and it:

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1️⃣ | Fetches flight history from OpenSky Network (dates, routes, callsigns) |
| 2️⃣ | Renders a **live interactive table** directly inside the Copilot chat |
| 3️⃣ | On clicking any row, **calls back to the MCP server in real time** for live aircraft state |
| 4️⃣ | Shows altitude, speed, heading, on-ground status — inline, no second prompt |
| 5️⃣ | Applies light/dark theming automatically from the M365 host |

**Two tools exposed:**
- `get_flights_by_aircraft` — flight history by date range
- `get_aircraft_state` — live position, altitude, speed, heading

**Three pre-built prompts:**
- `lookup_flights` — flight history for a given date
- `analyse_aircraft` — two-day pattern analysis
- `flight_briefing` — full briefing combining history and live state

**How data flows end to end:**
```
User types prompt
       │
[M365 Copilot LLM]  →  reads tools/list → sees _meta.ui.resourceUri
       │
tools/call  →  get_flights_by_aircraft(icao24, begin_date, end_date)
       │
[server.py]  →  OpenSky OAuth2 token  →  GET /api/flights/aircraft
               returns CallToolResult { content, structuredContent }
       │
M365 fetches ui://widget/flights.html  →  renders in sandboxed iframe
               injects window.openai.toolOutput = structuredContent
       │
Widget renders flight table
       │
  [User clicks a row]
       │
window.openai.callTool("get_aircraft_state", { icao24 })
               → GET /api/states/all
       │
Live state appears inline in the expanded row
```

## 🔍 What Are MCP Apps?

On **26 January 2026**, Anthropic and OpenAI — two companies that are, in most respects, competitors — jointly published **MCP Apps**, the first official extension to the Model Context Protocol since it launched.

MCP Apps enables MCP servers to deliver **interactive HTML UIs directly inside AI chat hosts** — M365 Copilot, ChatGPT, or anything that implements the spec.

**Before MCP Apps:** every host had incompatible UI mechanisms — ChatGPT, Teams, M365 each did something different.
**After MCP Apps:** write once, render anywhere.

> Production-ready. Not a preview. And almost nobody is talking about it yet.

### How it works — three entities

```
MCP Server               Host (M365 / ChatGPT)        Widget (sandboxed iframe)
─────────────────        ─────────────────────        ─────────────────────────
tools/list          →    reads _meta.ui.resourceUri
resources/read      →    renders iframe           →    receives structuredContent
tools/call          →    proxies postMessage      ←→   calls back via callTool
                         enforces CSP                  notifies height
```

### Key concepts at a glance

| Concept | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ui://` URI scheme | Widget resource address |
| `text/html;profile=mcp-app` | MIME type telling the host this is a widget |
| `_meta.ui.resourceUri` | On the **tool definition** — links a tool to its widget |
| `structuredContent` | Rich typed data in the tool result; keeps the model context clean |
| `window.openai.toolOutput` | How the widget receives data |
| `window.openai.callTool` | Widget calling back to an MCP tool |
| `window.openai.notifyIntrinsicHeight` | Auto-sizes the iframe |

**What the widget actually is:**
- 🖥️ A live iframe — not a screenshot, not a card
- 🔄 Calls back to your MCP server on user interaction
- 🎨 Responds to light/dark theme from the host
- 📐 Resizes itself to fit content
- 🧠 Runs *inside* the conversation, not alongside it

## 🃏 Why this is different from Adaptive Cards

If you have built on M365 or Teams, you have used Adaptive Cards. They work. But they have a fundamental limit.

| | Adaptive Cards | MCP Apps Widget |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Static snapshot | Live running application |
| **State** | Lost on every update | Lives in the widget |
| **Interaction** | New card per action | JS call inside iframe |
| **Context window** | Grows with each card payload | Untouched |
| **Data updates** | Replace the card | Update in place |
| **Layout** | Constrained by JSON schema | Full HTML/CSS control |
| **Portability** | Teams, Outlook, Copilot | Any MCP Apps compliant host |

**The flight tracker example makes this concrete:**
- With Adaptive Cards: click a row → ask a follow-up question → wait for model → receive new card → lose previous state
- With MCP Apps: click a row → one `callTool` call → live data appears inline. No second prompt. No model invocation.

> 💡 **Rule of thumb** — Use Adaptive Cards when data is complete at render time. Use MCP Apps widgets when the UI needs to stay alive after the tool call returns.

## 🛠️ Challenges and troubleshooting

Building this on early-stage tooling with sparse documentation involved real friction. The full challenges table — including all undocumented gotchas, error codes, root causes, and fixes — is documented in the repository README under [Critical Troubleshooting → Build and deployment challenges](https://github.com/your-org/flight-tracker-mcp#critical-troubleshooting).

The three issues that will silently prevent the widget from rendering in M365, and that took the longest to diagnose:

| Issue | Root cause |
|---|---|
| Widget never appears | `_meta` placed on `CallToolResult` — M365 reads it from `tools/list` at discovery time, not from the call result |
| Widget disappears after server fix | `mcp-tools.json` is a static snapshot; it had no `_meta` and was not re-provisioned after the server was corrected |
| Widget receives data, renders nothing | M365 delivers `structuredContent` unwrapped; widget must handle both `toolOutput.structuredContent` and `toolOutput` directly |

---

## 🚀 What this actually unlocks

The flight tracker is a demo. Here is what the same pattern does in production:

| Use case | What the widget does |
|---|---|
| 🎫 **IT service desk** | Live ticket list with per-row escalate button — no portal switch |
| 📋 **Sprint planning** | Reorderable backlog inside the chat; assign and close without leaving |
| 🚨 **Incident response** | Live log viewer where the on-call engineer is already working |
| 💰 **Financial reporting** | Drillable P&L — click a line, see the underlying transactions |
| 🏭 **IoT / operations** | Shop floor sensor widget; acknowledge alerts in chat |
| 🔐 **Security operations** | Alert triage inline; mark false positives, trigger response actions |
| 🗺️ **Field operations** | Live map widget with clickable assets and status overlays |
| 📊 **Executive dashboards** | KPI widget that updates as the conversation refines the filter |

> The common thread: situations where users need to **do something with data**, not just read it. Adaptive Cards show data. MCP Apps widgets let you act on it — in place, without losing context.

## 💡 The broader point

MCP Apps is **six weeks old** as I write this (March 2026).

- ✅ Spec is production-ready
- ✅ FastMCP supports it (`meta=` parameter, v1.26+)
- ✅ M365 Agents Toolkit supports the full widget lifecycle
- ❌ Practical knowledge of what breaks and why isn't written down yet

That is the gap this article fills.

**The widget rendered. It was worth it.**
