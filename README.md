> **TL;DR** — Build a Python MCP server that renders a live interactive flight table inside M365 Copilot. Three non-obvious fixes determine whether the widget appears: `_meta` placement on the tool definition, the `mcp-tools.json` snapshot, and the `toolOutput` data format. If the widget is not rendering, skip directly to [Critical Troubleshooting](#critical-troubleshooting).

## App Functionality

A **Flight Tracker MCP server** that connects to Microsoft 365 Copilot (and ChatGPT) as a Declarative Agent. Given any aircraft's ICAO24 transponder code, the agent:

1. Fetches flight history from the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) API
2. Renders a **live interactive widget** — a flight table directly inside the Copilot chat
3. On clicking any flight row, **calls back to the MCP server in real time** to retrieve the aircraft's live position, altitude, speed, and heading
4. Applies light/dark theming automatically from the host
5. Suppresses model text — the widget is the response

The agent exposes two tools (`get_flights_by_aircraft`, `get_aircraft_state`) and three pre-built prompts (`lookup_flights`, `analyse_aircraft`, `flight_briefing`).

The UX is rather efficient: no walls of text, no redundant summaries. The widget speaks for itself — which is, frankly, more than can be said for most enterprise software.

### End-to-End Data Flow

```
User types prompt
       │
       ▼
[M365 Copilot LLM]
  reads tools/list → sees _meta.ui.resourceUri on tool definition
       │
       ▼
tools/call → get_flights_by_aircraft(icao24, begin_date, end_date)

       ▼
[server.py]
  → POST auth.opensky-network.org  (OAuth2 token)
  → GET  opensky-network.org/api/flights/aircraft
  → returns CallToolResult { content, structuredContent }
       │
       ▼
M365 fetches ui://widget/flights.html  (ReadResource)
  → renders HTML in sandboxed iframe
  → injects window.openai.toolOutput = structuredContent
       │
       ▼
Widget renders flight table
       │
  [User clicks a row]

window.openai.callTool("get_aircraft_state", { icao24 })
  → [server.py] → GET opensky-network.org/api/states/all
  → structuredContent { altitude, speed, heading, ... }
       │
       ▼
Live aircraft state appears inline in the expanded row

## What Are MCP Apps?

[MCP Apps](https://apps.extensions.modelcontextprotocol.io/api/documents/Overview.html) is an **official extension to the Model Context Protocol** that enables MCP servers to deliver interactive HTML user interfaces directly inside AI chat hosts. The distinction is between a civil servant reading out a spreadsheet aloud and simply handing it over — MCP Apps opts for the latter.

Before MCP Apps, every host (ChatGPT, Claude, M365) had incompatible UI mechanisms. MCP Apps standardises this into a **write-once, render-anywhere** pattern.

### Architecture

```
MCP Server              Host (M365 / ChatGPT)       Widget (sandboxed iframe)
──────────────────      ─────────────────────       ─────────────────────────
tools/list          →   reads _meta.ui.resourceUri
resources/read      →   renders iframe           →   receives structuredContent
tools/call          →   proxies postMessage      ←→  calls back via callTool
                        enforces CSP                 notifies height
```

Three entities:
- **Server** — declares tools with `_meta.ui.resourceUri` pointing to HTML resources
- **Host** — fetches the HTML resource, renders it in a sandboxed iframe
- **Widget** — receives `structuredContent` from the tool result, calls tools back, reports height

### Key Concepts

| Concept | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ui://` URI scheme | Widget resource address, e.g. `ui://widget/flights.html` |
| `text/html;profile=mcp-app` | MIME type that tells the host this is a widget, not a document |
| `_meta.ui.resourceUri` | On the **tool definition** — links a tool to its widget |
| `structuredContent` | Rich typed data in the tool result; keeps model context clean |
| `window.openai.toolOutput` | How the widget receives the tool result in ChatGPT / M365 |
| `window.openai.callTool` | Widget calling back to an MCP tool |
| `window.openai.notifyIntrinsicHeight` | Auto-sizes the iframe to content height |

### MCP Apps Widgets vs Adaptive Cards

Developers familiar with Microsoft 365 extensibility will reasonably ask: why not just use Adaptive Cards?

Adaptive Cards are a JSON-based declarative schema. The host renders them natively — consistent styling across Teams, Outlook, and Copilot, with zero custom code. They are well-suited to structured notifications, simple forms, and approval flows.

MCP Apps widgets are full HTML/CSS/JavaScript running in a sandboxed iframe. The developer controls everything.

| Capability | Adaptive Cards | MCP Apps Widget |
|---|---|---|
| Rendering | Host-rendered from JSON schema | Browser-rendered HTML in iframe |
| Interactivity | Predefined action types only | Any JavaScript interaction |
| Real-time data | Static at render; refresh requires a new card | Calls back to MCP server at any time via `callTool` |
| Styling | Host controls appearance | Full CSS control; consistent everywhere |
| Custom layout | Constrained by card schema | Unconstrained |
| Portability | Teams, Outlook, Copilot, many hosts | Any MCP Apps compliant host |
| Build complexity | JSON only; no code | Requires HTML/JS development |

**For the Flight Tracker specifically:** An Adaptive Card could display the flight table — but only as a static snapshot. Clicking a row to fetch live aircraft state is not possible within a card; it would require the user to ask a follow-up question, triggering a second tool call and a second card.

The Flight Tracker widget handles this in a single interaction: the table renders, the user clicks a row, `callTool` fires `get_aircraft_state`, and the live state appears inline — no second prompt, no additional model invocation.

> 💡 **Rule of thumb** — Use Adaptive Cards when the data is complete at render time. Use MCP Apps widgets when the UI needs to remain active after the initial tool call returns. Adaptive Cards are a very competent filing clerk. The MCP Apps widget is the analyst who follows up.

### M365 Copilot Support Status

M365 Copilot supports the OpenAI Apps SDK widget bridge. Full capability matrix: [Microsoft Learn – UI widgets for declarative agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/declarative-agent-ui-widgets).

Supported APIs:
- `window.openai.toolOutput` ✅
- `window.openai.callTool` ✅
- `window.openai.notifyIntrinsicHeight` ✅
- `window.openai.theme` ✅
- `window.openai.requestDisplayMode` ✅ (fullscreen only)
- `window.openai.sendFollowUpMessage` ✅

> ⚠️ **Preview note** — MCP Apps native support (`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`) is listed as "coming soon" on the M365 docs. Current support is via the **OpenAI Apps SDK bridge** (`window.openai.*`). This will change — watch the M365 release notes.

## Key Scripts

### `server.py` — The MCP Server

Built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) (Python MCP SDK 1.26). This is the core of the application.

**Resource registration** — the widget HTML is registered as an MCP resource with the `text/html;profile=mcp-app` MIME type, identifying it to any compliant host as a UI widget:

```python
@mcp.resource("ui://widget/flights.html", mime_type="text/html;profile=mcp-app")
async def flight_widget() -> str:
    return WIDGET_HTML
```

**Tool registration** — both tools carry `meta={"ui": {"resourceUri": ...}}` on the decorator. This places `_meta` on the **tool definition** in `tools/list`, which is where M365 reads it:

```python
@mcp.tool(
    description="...",
    meta={"ui": {"resourceUri": "ui://widget/flights.html"}},
)
async def get_flights_by_aircraft(icao24, begin_date, end_date) -> types.CallToolResult:
    return types.CallToolResult(
        content=[types.TextContent(type="text", text=summary)],
        structuredContent={"icao24": icao24, "total_flights": n, "flights": [...]},
    )
```

> ⚠️ **Critical** — `_meta` must be on the `@mcp.tool()` decorator, not in `CallToolResult`. See [Issue 1](#issue-1----meta-must-be-on-the-tool-definition-not-the-call-result).

**Two tools:**
- `get_flights_by_aircraft(icao24, begin_date, end_date)` — fetches flight history from OpenSky; returns callsign, departure/arrival airports, timestamps
- `get_aircraft_state(icao24)` — fetches live state: position, altitude, speed, heading, on-ground status

**Three prompts** (pre-built conversation starters):
- `lookup_flights` — flight history for a given date
- `analyse_aircraft` — two-day pattern analysis
- `flight_briefing` — full briefing combining history and live state

**Entry point** — Streamable HTTP server on port 3000 with CORS middleware:

```python
def main():
    app = mcp.streamable_http_app()
    app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=["*"], ...)
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=3000)
```

---

### `widget.html` — The UI Widget

A **single self-contained HTML file** with no build step, no framework, no bundler. Vanilla HTML and JavaScript, served directly by the MCP server as a resource and rendered inside a sandboxed iframe in Copilot chat.

Key behaviours:
- Receives flight data via `window.openai.toolOutput` and renders a flight table
- Click-to-expand rows call `get_aircraft_state` in real time via `window.openai.callTool`
- Light/dark theming via CSS custom properties applied from `window.openai.theme`
- Auto-height notification via `window.openai.notifyIntrinsicHeight`
- Polling pattern to handle M365's delayed injection of `window.openai`

> 📝 **Note** — The widget is cloned with the repository in Step 2. Developers extending it should review the `render()`, `toggleRow()`, and `tryRenderFromOpenAI()` functions, and the `--color-*` CSS variables for theming.

---

### `widget_test.html` — Local Test Harness

A standalone HTML page that simulates M365/ChatGPT postMessage data delivery. Allows the widget to be tested entirely locally — no live server, no tunnel, no M365 account required. Includes mock flight data, a dark/light toggle, and an event log panel. Use this before every M365 deployment.

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, confirm all of the following are in place:

- [ ] Python 3.11+
- [ ] Microsoft 365 tenant with Copilot licence
- [ ] Custom App Upload enabled on the tenant
- [ ] Copilot Access enabled on the tenant
- [ ] VS Code + [M365 Agents Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) v6.5.2x prerelease or later
- [ ] [Microsoft Dev Tunnels CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started) installed
- [ ] [OpenSky Network account](https://opensky-network.org) (free) with an OAuth2 client application created
- [ ] [MCP Inspector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector) available (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`)
- [ ] Node.js installed (for MCP Inspector)

---

## Set-up

### Step 1 — Environment

```bash
cd C:\demoprojects\flight-tracker-mcp
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install "mcp[cli]" httpx python-dotenv uvicorn starlette
```

---

### Step 2 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/flight-tracker-mcp.git
cd flight-tracker-mcp
```

Confirm the following files are present:

```
flight_tracker_mcp/server.py
flight_tracker_mcp/web/widget.html
tests/widget_test.html
.env.example
pyproject.toml
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate the OpenSky credentials (see Step 4).

Start the server:

```bash
python -m flight_tracker_mcp.server
```

Expected: `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:3000`

---

### Step 3 — Set up Dev Tunnel (named, persistent)

A named tunnel provides a **permanent public hostname** that does not change between sessions. This is essential — an ephemeral tunnel URL breaks the agent manifest on every restart.

```bash
# One-time login
devtunnel user login -d

# Create named tunnel (run once)
devtunnel create flight-tracker --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create flight-tracker --port-number 3000

# Start tunnel (each session)
devtunnel host flight-tracker --allow-anonymous
```

Permanent URL format: `https://flight-tracker-3000.{region}.devtunnels.ms`

Verify the tunnel is live:

```bash
curl https://flight-tracker-3000.inc1.devtunnels.ms/mcp
```

Expected: JSON response.

#### Troubleshooting

> ⚠️ **WAM Error (Error Code: 3399614466)** — `devtunnel user login` fails on Windows via the Windows Authentication Manager broker. Use `devtunnel user login -d` to force device code flow in the browser.

> ⚠️ **Ephemeral URL on restart** — The browser connect URL shown at startup (e.g. `lzvf27m0.inc1.devtunnels.ms`) is always ephemeral. The *named* tunnel hostname (`flight-tracker-3000.inc1.devtunnels.ms`) is permanent. Only the permanent hostname belongs in `ai-plugin.json`.

---

### Step 4 — OpenSky Network API

Register at [opensky-network.org](https://opensky-network.org) → create an OAuth2 client application → obtain `client_id` and `client_secret`.

```ini
# .env
OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

Token endpoint:

```
https://auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/protocol/openid-connect/token
```

#### Troubleshooting

> ⚠️ **403 Forbidden** — Incorrect token endpoint. The OpenSky API uses a Keycloak realm URL, not `opensky-network.org/api/auth/token`. Use the endpoint above.

> ⚠️ **401 Unauthorised** — HTTP Basic Auth is not accepted. Use OAuth2 `grant_type=client_credentials` and pass `Authorization: Bearer {token}`.

---

### Step 5 — Test the Widget Locally

Before connecting to M365, verify the widget renders correctly:

```bash
# Open in browser directly
tests/widget_test.html
```

Use **Send Mock Flights** to trigger a render and **Toggle Dark/Light** to verify theming. No server or tunnel required.

> 💡 **Always test locally first.** Debugging inside the M365 iframe is considerably less pleasant than debugging in a browser with DevTools open.

---

### Step 6 — Verify with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Connect using **Streamable HTTP** transport to `https://flight-tracker-3000.inc1.devtunnels.ms/mcp`.

Verify the following before proceeding to M365:

- [ ] `tools/list` returns both tools with `_meta: { ui: { resourceUri: "ui://widget/flights.html" } }`
- [ ] `resources/list` returns `ui://widget/flights.html` with MIME type `text/html;profile=mcp-app`
- [ ] Calling `get_flights_by_aircraft` returns `structuredContent` with a `flights` array

> 📝 MCP Inspector v0.21.1 shows no entry in the "MCPApp" tab for Python servers — the Python SDK does not announce the `ext-apps` capability. This does **not** affect functionality in M365 or ChatGPT. A perfectly functional system appearing deficient in the inspector is, one notes, rather a civil service tradition.

---

### Step 7 — The Widget (`widget.html`)

The widget is served live from the MCP server — no re-provision is needed when it changes. Developers extending it should be familiar with:

- `--color-*` CSS variables in `:root` (light) and `[data-theme="dark"]` (dark) for theming
- `render(data)` — builds the flight table from `structuredContent`
- `toggleRow(idx)` — expands a row and calls `get_aircraft_state` via `window.openai.callTool`
- `tryRenderFromOpenAI()` + polling loop — handles M365's delayed `window.openai` injection

#### Troubleshooting

> ⚠️ **"Loading flight data..." stuck in M365** — `window.openai` is injected after the script runs. A direct startup check always misses it. The polling loop (30 × 100ms) resolves this.

> ⚠️ **Invisible widget in M365** — CSS `background: transparent` renders the widget invisible in the M365 iframe. Set `--color-bg: #ffffff` (light) and `--color-bg: #1a1a1a` (dark) explicitly.

---

### Step 8 — Create the M365 Declarative Agent

**Steps:**

1. VS Code → Agents Toolkit → **Create a New Agent/App** → Declarative Agent → Start with MCP Server
2. Enter MCP server URL: `https://flight-tracker-3000.inc1.devtunnels.ms/mcp`
3. Open `.vscode/mcp.json` → click **Start**, then **ATK: Fetch action from MCP** → select `ai-plugin.json`
4. Select both tools → authentication: **None** (development mode)
5. Confirm the runtime URL in `ai-plugin.json` matches the named tunnel URL
6. Update `mcp-tools.json` — **see [Issue 2](#issue-2----mcp-toolsjson-must-include-_meta) before proceeding**
7. Agents Toolkit → Lifecycle → **Provision**
8. Test at [https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat)

---

## Critical Troubleshooting

> ⚠️ These three issues are undocumented and will silently prevent the widget from rendering in M365. Work through the diagnostic checklist first, then refer to the detailed fix for any failing item.

### Diagnostic Checklist

Widget not rendering? Work through this list in order:

- [ ] Is `_meta` on the `@mcp.tool()` decorator — not in `CallToolResult`?
- [ ] Does `mcp-tools.json` contain `_meta.ui.resourceUri` for each tool?
- [ ] Was the agent re-provisioned after updating `mcp-tools.json`?
- [ ] Is the tunnel running with `--allow-anonymous`?
- [ ] Does the tunnel URL in `ai-plugin.json` match the named tunnel hostname (not the ephemeral one)?
- [ ] Is `outputTemplate: ""` absent from `ai-plugin.json`?
- [ ] Is the widget handling both wrapped and unwrapped `toolOutput` formats?

---

### `_meta` must be on the tool definition, not the call result

M365 reads `_meta.ui.resourceUri` from the `tools/list` response at connection time — not from individual call results. Placing it only on `CallToolResult` means the widget is never fetched.

**Incorrect:**
```python
return types.CallToolResult(
    content=[...],
    structuredContent={...},
    _meta={"ui": {"resourceUri": WIDGET_URI}},  # M365 does not read this
)
```

**Correct:**
```python
@mcp.tool(
    description="...",
    meta={"ui": {"resourceUri": WIDGET_URI}},   # M365 reads this from tools/list
)
async def get_flights_by_aircraft(...):
    return types.CallToolResult(
        content=[...],
        structuredContent={...},
    )
```

> 📝 FastMCP 1.26+ supports `meta=` on `@mcp.tool()`. This maps directly to `_meta` in the `tools/list` protocol response.

---

### `mcp-tools.json` must include `_meta`

`mcp-tools.json` is the **static snapshot of `tools/list`** M365 uses at deploy time. It is generated by ATK's "Fetch action from MCP" step. If `_meta` is added to the server after this file was generated, M365 will have no knowledge of the widget.

Manually add `_meta` to each tool entry:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "get_flights_by_aircraft",
      "description": "...",
      "inputSchema": { "..." },
      "title": "Get flights by aircraft",
      "_meta": {
        "ui": {
          "resourceUri": "ui://widget/flights.html"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Re-provision via Agents Toolkit after updating this file.

> This is the "Yes, Minister" of MCP development: the server is functioning, the tool is being called, data is returning — yet the widget does not appear. The reason, it transpires, is that `mcp-tools.json` filed the original paperwork without the widget declaration, and M365 — being a conscientious bureaucrat — acted precisely on what it was told.

---

### `window.openai.toolOutput` data format varies between hosts

In M365, `window.openai.toolOutput` may deliver `structuredContent` as the top-level object rather than wrapped inside `{ structuredContent: {...} }`. The widget must handle both:

```javascript
var out = window.openai.toolOutput;
var data = (out && out.structuredContent !== undefined)
  ? out.structuredContent
  : out;
render(data);
```

---

### What `outputTemplate: ""` breaks

Adding `"outputTemplate": ""` to `ai-plugin.json` causes M365 to abandon widget rendering and generate its own text summary from `structuredContent`. The widget disappears entirely. Use `instruction.txt` to suppress model commentary instead.

---

### Build and deployment challenges

Real-world friction points encountered during development. None are covered in the getting-started documentation.

| Challenge | What happened | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Widget invisible in M365** | `background: transparent` renders the iframe invisible | Set `--color-bg: #ffffff` (light) and `#1a1a1a` (dark) explicitly in CSS |
| **"Loading flight data..." stuck** | `window.openai` injected after script runs | Poll 30 × 100ms until available |
| **WAM Error 3399614466** | `devtunnel user login` fails on Windows via auth broker | Use `devtunnel user login -d` (device code flow) |
| **Ephemeral tunnel URL breaks manifest** | Named tunnel shows ephemeral URL at startup | Use only the permanent hostname in `ai-plugin.json` |
| **OpenSky 403 Forbidden** | Wrong token endpoint | Use Keycloak realm URL: `auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/...` |
| **OpenSky 401 Unauthorised** | Tried HTTP Basic Auth | Use OAuth2 `grant_type=client_credentials` + Bearer token |
| **`outputTemplate: ""` kills the widget** | Added to suppress model text; M365 abandons widget rendering entirely | Remove it; use `instruction.txt` instead |
| **No console in M365 iframe** | Can't open DevTools inside the hosted widget | Test fully with `widget_test.html` locally before deploying to M365 |
| **Widget state lost on chat re-open** | `ontoolresult` doesn't re-fire for historical messages | No clean solution yet — open issue in the ecosystem |
| **Python/Node.js parity gap** | `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` is TypeScript-only | Python uses FastMCP `meta=` parameter + `window.openai.*` bridge manually |

---

## Developer Community Challenges

The MCP Apps ecosystem is active and maturing rapidly. The following challenges are commonly encountered:

| Challenge | Summary |
|---|---|
| **UI state on re-open** | When users return to a chat, `ontoolresult` does not re-fire for historical messages. Widget loads in empty state. No clean solution yet. ([GitHub #195](https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples/issues/195)) |
| **Python/Node.js parity gap** | `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` is TypeScript-only. Python servers must use FastMCP's `meta=` parameter and handle the `window.openai.*` bridge manually — no `useApp()` hook equivalent. |
| **`mcp-tools.json` is a manual step** | ATK requires a static snapshot of `tools/list`. Any change to tool metadata requires re-fetching, editing, and re-provisioning. Acknowledged as temporary in the official docs. |
| **Debugging inside the iframe** | No accessible browser console in M365. Diagnosis requires cross-referencing server logs, MCP Inspector, and considerable patience. |
| **Dev tunnel lifecycle** | Ephemeral tunnels break manifests on restart. Named tunnels resolve this. `--allow-anonymous` is required or M365 is redirected to a login page mid-session. |
| **`ext-apps` capability not announced by Python SDK** | MCP Inspector shows no MCP Apps capability for Python servers. Currently harmless, but may matter as hosts begin gating features behind capability negotiation. |
| **M365 preview limitations** | MCP Apps native support is "coming soon". Current support is OpenAI Apps SDK bridge only. Fullscreen-only `requestDisplayMode`; no modals; no file upload. |
| **CSP and CORS for widget callbacks** | `callTool` requests originate from `{hashed-domain}.widget-renderer.usercontent.microsoft.com`. CORS must allow this. Use the [Widget Host URL Generator](https://aka.ms/mcpwidgeturlgenerator). |
